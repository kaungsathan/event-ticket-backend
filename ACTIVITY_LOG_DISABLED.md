# Activity Logging - Temporarily Disabled

## Status
Activity logging has been temporarily disabled throughout the application as per request.

## What was disabled:
- All `activity()` helper function calls in service classes
- Event creation/update/deletion logging
- Order management logging (confirm, cancel, refund, delete)
- Organizer management logging (create, update, verify, activate, etc.)

## Files modified:
- `app/Domains/Events/Services/EventService.php`
- `app/Domains/Orders/Services/OrderService.php`
- `app/Domains/Organizers/Services/OrganizerService.php`

## How to re-enable:
When you want to re-enable activity logging:

1. **Uncomment all activity logging code** - Search for "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" in the service files and uncomment the activity() blocks
2. **Publish activity log config** (if needed):
   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ActivityLog\ActivitylogServiceProvider" --tag="activitylog-migrations"
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ActivityLog\ActivitylogServiceProvider" --tag="activitylog-config"
   ```
3. **Run migrations** (if not already run):
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

## Package information:
- Package: `spatie/laravel-activitylog`: `^4.10`
- Migrations present in: `database/migrations/`
  - `2025_08_14_075716_create_activity_log_table.php`
  - `2025_08_14_075717_add_event_column_to_activity_log_table.php`
  - `2025_08_14_075718_add_batch_uuid_column_to_activity_log_table.php`

## Note:
The activity log package is still installed and the migrations are available. Only the actual logging calls have been commented out, so the application functionality remains unchanged - just without activity tracking.
